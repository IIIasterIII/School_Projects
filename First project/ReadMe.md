# 🚀 Project Setup

## 1. Starting the Backend 🛠️

Navigate to the **server** directory:

```bash
cd server
```

Then, start the server. The command depends on the version of Python installed on your device:
- If you have Python 3:
  ```bash
    python3 main.py
  ```
- If you have Python:
  ```bash
    python main.py
  ```

## 2. Starting the Frontend 🌐
Navigate to the client/api_motivazione directory:
  ```bash
cd client/api_motivazione

```
Install all dependencies by running the command:

  ```bash
npm install

```
Start the project in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev

```

After that, the terminal will display the address of the local server. Press the O key (Latin) to automatically open the site in your browser.

💡 Tip: If the site does not open, manually copy the address and paste it into the browser's address bar.
